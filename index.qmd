# Preliminaries

## Agenda

- Why share data & materials
- When to share...
- Where to share...
- How to share...

# Why share data

## Transparency

## Accelerate discovery

## Improve rigor

## Strengthen reproducibility

- What's your project's "bus number"?
- Could someone else on your team reproduce analyses done by X?
- *Methods* reproducibility [@Goodman2016-fi]

## Meet a requirement

- Funder
- Journal
- Institutional
- Professional organization

## Ethical duty

>*Whereas regulators of human subjects research often view data sharing solely in terms of potential risks to subjects, we argue that the principles of human subject research require an analysis of both risks
and benefits, and that such an analysis suggests that **researchers may have a positive duty to share data** in order to maximize the contribution that individual participants have made.* [@Brakewood2013-wj]

# When to share

## When NOT to share...

- When you've milked every last ounce of information out of a dataset, and all that remains is a lifeless, shriveled husk

## On submission

- Some journals require that authors submit data for review. Ex, *Nature Scientific Data* 

![](img/nsd_policy.png){fig-align="center"}

- Reviewers have the option to review the data along with the manuscript.

- Bruce had experience of reviewer at NSD pointing out that numbers from the manuscript did not match data repository.

## After acceptance

- Pre-publication verification (separate from review) increasingly common
![](img/jop_policy.png) 
- Can take up to six months of back-and-forth with journal assistant.

- Leads to more careful organization pre-submission.

## On publication

- Post and disseminate data and code with paper.
- Creates independent way to get cites.

## End of grant period

- Major funders require data/material/publication sharing

# Where to share data

## Data repository

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Dataverse (linked to journal article)
- Databrary.org (esp. video/audio, identifiable data)
- Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
- Open Science Framework (OSF)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- PSU ScholarSphere
- PSU Data Commons
- NIH Data Archive
- Zenodo.org

:::

## Why repositories?

- Long-term storage (preservation, in FAIR forms)
- Data "communities"
- Access
- Specialized expertise (e.g., curation)
- Persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) enable citation & tracking

## Alternatives to repositories

- Supplemental materials
- Lab/project website

## Data journal

n.b.-- Gilmore is on editorial board.

- Could be extra pub
- Especially good for early-career researchers

## FAIR principles

![](img/FAIR_data_principles.jpg){fig-align="center"}

[@Wilkinson2016-qr]

## FAIR in-practice

- **F**indable
    - Repository or journal with persistent identifier
- **Accessible**
    - Not behind paywall
- **I**nteroperable
    - \{.txt, .csv\} vs. \{.docx, .xlsx\}
- **R**eusable
    - Data definitions/dictionary
    - Code to visualize/analyze

## CARE principles

![[@Carroll2021-cr]](img/fair-care.png){fig-align="center"}

## Seek permission to share

- Sensitive & identifiable data can (often) be shared with *restricted audiences* (i.e., researchers)
    - e.g., Databrary (databrary.org)
- Qualitative Data Repository (QDR; qdr.syracuse.edu)
- Sharing $\neq$ public access

## Final thoughts

- Plan for sharing as early as possible
- Data + code $\rightarrow$ reproducible analyses
- Internally reproducible $\rightarrow$ easier to share
